# homebrew-personal

Here I keep a couple formulae and casks for utilities outside of the mainstream, or too old for inclusion in the mainline Homebrew taps.

# Usage

After you install homebrew-personal, run the following command:

```sh
$ brew tap zacs/personal
```

You can now install weird and alternate Formulae and Casks.

```sh
$ brew cask install adobe-photoshop-cs6
```
